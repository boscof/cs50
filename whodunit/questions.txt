1.  stdint.h is a header file that assigns alternative names to specific data types.
2.  "unit8_t", "unit16_t" and "unit32_t" are unsigned 8-bit, 16-bit or 32-bit integer types while "int32_t" is a signed 32-bit integer type. 
    These data types limit the range of numeric values that a specified input or output in a program can assume.
3.  1 byte, 4 byte, 4 byte and 2 bytes respectively.

5.  bfsize is the size of the bitmap file while bisize is the size of the BITMAPINFOHEADER struct
6.  If biheight is negative it means that the bitmap is stored such that the top row of the image is stored first and the bottom row is stored last.
7.  biBitCount
8.  If the file cannot be found or opened, fopen will return NULL
9.  Because you want the code to return the part that has been read as one element
