0.  It is the longest word in the dictionary (large). Hence, why length is defined as 45.
1.  getrusage returns resource usages measures to measure the efficiency of the program.
2.  16
3.  Because structs are passed by reference instead of by value. Otherwise, they would be too big.
4.  The for loop in speller.c works by reading each character in a given file and adding those that form words to an array
    called word. Words containing numbers and too many characters are omitted, while the rest of the characters are assumed to be 
    words. Every time a new word is added to the array, the word counter updates. The program then checks to see if the words are 
    correctly spelt by calling on a function called misspelled and recording the time it takes for the code to run. If the word is 
    misspelt, the code prints the misspelt word and increases the counter for the number of misspelt words by one.
5.  fgetc allows for more control over which characters are read. Reading each word by string may introduce problems
    when there are numbers or special characters contained within the string.
6.  To ensure that none of the words within the files and dictonaries that are loaded will be altered.
